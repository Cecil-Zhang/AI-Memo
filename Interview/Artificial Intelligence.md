### What's the difference between RL and Supervised learning?
|Reinforcement Learning|Supervised Learning|
|---|---|
|RL is all about making decisions sequentially. In simple words we can say that the output depends on the state of the current input and the next input depends on the output of the previous input.|In Supervised learning the decision is made on the initial input or the input given at the start.|
|Decisions are dependent, so we give labels to sequences of dependent decision.|Decisions are independent of each other so labels are given to each decision.|
|Example: Chess game|Example: Object recognition|
